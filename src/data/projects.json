[{"title":"Udemy Burger Builder","path":"udemy-burger-builder","content":"The beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic started in my last term of university. At the time, I only had a single class left due to scheduling conflicts in previous terms and mismatch coops, so I was able to work on personal projects. In the beginning, I focused on machine learning projects. After seeing many job postings regarding web development, I knew I needed to work on my web development skills.\n\nUniversity did not teach web development and only gave a few opportunities to work on web development projects. The desire to expand my web development skills brought me to Udemy. I bought a [guide for ReactJS](https://www.udemy.com/course/react-the-complete-guide-incl-redux/ \"React The Complete Guide Udemy Course\"), which is taught by [Maximilian Schwarzmüller](https://www.udemy.com/user/academind/ \"Maximilian Schwarzmüller Udemy Profile\"). This course covered basic and advanced topics for ReactJS.\n\nThe main project for this course was a burger builder app. This app allows a user to create a burger by selecting the ingredients and amounts, continue to checkout, and view their burger orders. Users must create a profile to continue to checkout.\n\n![Burger Builder App](//images.ctfassets.net/96ovba1yjdbm/4DOX3zr2a9r7FQgfqBG8uM/118fe7ffe3be7f1e88d08e5213c593da/burgerbuilder.PNG)\n\nThis course has 490 video lectures approximating to about 40.5 hours of video. Some video lectures are bonus material that looks at 'Next.js,' CSS, and animations.\n\nSome components of the app are:\n- Hosted on Firebase\n- Uses the Firebase real-time database\n- Authentication with Firebase\n- React Routing\n- Redux\n- Axios\n- React Memo for a performance increase of 'dumb' components\n- Custom Hooks\n- Converted class base components to functional components\n- 'useState' and 'useEffect' are used to replace state and class-based component lifecycle hooks.\n- Unit Tests with Jest and Enzyme\n\nSee the [code](https://github.com/SDBurt/udemy-react-course/tree/master/burger-app \"Burger Builder App on Github\") on github or [Demo](https://burger-app-cdc9b.web.app/ \"Burger Builder App demo\") site.\n","imageAlt":"Burger Builder burger","icon":{"sys":{"space":{"sys":{"type":"Link","linkType":"Space","id":"96ovba1yjdbm"}},"id":"1Xbemp1jshL7tTKEIjV1Ci","type":"Asset","createdAt":"2020-10-01T18:33:29.534Z","updatedAt":"2020-10-01T20:25:27.038Z","environment":{"sys":{"id":"master","type":"Link","linkType":"Environment"}},"revision":2,"locale":"en-US"},"fields":{"title":"Burger Builder Burger","description":"Built burger with lettuce on the bottom.","file":{"url":"//images.ctfassets.net/96ovba1yjdbm/1Xbemp1jshL7tTKEIjV1Ci/afd742867fd5242e95c201a984ba47d4/burgerbuildericon.PNG","details":{"size":20185,"image":{"width":640,"height":387}},"fileName":"burgerbuildericon.PNG","contentType":"image/png"}}},"updatedAt":"2020-10-01T20:33:10.651Z"},{"title":"Portfolio Site","path":"portfolio-site","content":"I have been working on this portfolio site since I completed the Udemy course for ReactJS. I took what I learned from this course and quickly made this site, but with some extra components.\n\n- Instead of hosting on Firebase, I decided to try Netlify.\n- I knew I would be writing a lot of content and decided to use a CMS. I tried Contentful and decided to stick with that. I also though about using Gatsby but that might be a different project in the future.\n- All ReactJS components are functional components.\n- Redux was not used. Since there is no authentication and extensive passing of states, I felt it would be more more than use.\n- I hook is used to trigger a rebuild when Contentful publishes a new entity.\n- I plan to work on CSS more and add animations in the future (once I have content on here)\n- I also need a link to my resume.","imageAlt":"Macbooklaptop cutoff view","icon":{"sys":{"space":{"sys":{"type":"Link","linkType":"Space","id":"96ovba1yjdbm"}},"id":"7mOizigyp9VHcrGTaKDtEj","type":"Asset","createdAt":"2020-10-01T18:42:36.176Z","updatedAt":"2020-10-01T18:42:36.176Z","environment":{"sys":{"id":"master","type":"Link","linkType":"Environment"}},"revision":1,"locale":"en-US"},"fields":{"title":"Mac Laptop Cutoff View","description":"Photo by Math from Pexels","file":{"url":"//images.ctfassets.net/96ovba1yjdbm/7mOizigyp9VHcrGTaKDtEj/b081d9fd0e6544030d543767c2d1a7c0/pexels-math-331684.jpg","details":{"size":19970,"image":{"width":640,"height":423}},"fileName":"pexels-math-331684.jpg","contentType":"image/jpeg"}}},"updatedAt":"2020-10-01T18:43:08.917Z"}]

[{"title":"DistilBert for Question Answering","path":"distilbert-question-answering","content":"As a machine learning enthusiast, I always enjoy working on complex machine learning models, especially models in the natural language processing (NLP) domain. The next steps after building a model is deploying so others can try out the model. I rarely get to this step before working on a different project. I wanted to deploy a machine learning model to a serverless stack, so I found [this](https://www.philschmid.de/serverless-bert-with-huggingface-and-aws-lambda) tutorial after some trial and error tutorials. This project article summarizes the tutorial and my thoughts on the outcome.\n\nThis project uses a DistilBERT model provided by Huggingface that is fine-tuned for question answering. The Bert language model is a state of the art NLP technique developed by Google. A smaller version of this model, called DistilBert, is used for this project. [HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co/ \"Huggingface Website\") is a company which provides a machine learning library for Python that allows developers to use and extend many models for NLP. The model is deployed to AWS using the Serverless framework. [Serverless](https://www.serverless.com/ \"Serverless Framework Website\") is an open source project that allows developers to easily and quickly deploy projects to any FaaS provider. \n\nUsing Serverless, the fine-tuned DistilBert model is deployed to AWS. The trained model is stored in a S3 storage. API gateway triggers a lambda function that unzips dependencies and downloads the model from the S3 storage into the `tmp` folder. This folder is used because the model and the imports are too large for the function size limit of 250MB unzipped, and the `tmp` folder allows for an extra 512MB of space.\n\nThis size limit was a pain point for this project. Thankfully, Serverless allows for plugins. One important plugin is `serverless-python-requirements`. This plugin allows for the dependencies to be bundled after cleaning and slimming is done. A good overview of the serverlessCPU versions of PyTorch also lowered the library size.\n\nAnother pain point is the warm-up time for an AWS lambda function. The cold-start time is roughly 30 seconds, aligning with the timeout time for an API gateway call. When the cold-start time exceeds 30 seconds, another call is needed to retrieve the model's answer.\n\nThis method will be less painful to deploy for smaller models, or ones that do not require PyTorch. Hopefully `serverless-python-requirements` also updates their docker component for `wsl2`. Deploying fails unless you change the if statement to :\n\n---\n    ```\n    function getBindPath(serverless, servicePath) {\n    // Determine bind path\n    if (process.platform !== 'win32' && isWsl) {\n       return servicePath;\n    }\n    ```\n---\n\nnormally `iswsl` is `!iswsl`.\n\nSee [demo](https://d2hrnmmndlz71m.cloudfront.net/ \"Bert for Question Answering\")","imageAlt":"lightbulb","icon":{"sys":{"space":{"sys":{"type":"Link","linkType":"Space","id":"96ovba1yjdbm"}},"id":"3AMpzTspQkESn0b3QyflzJ","type":"Asset","createdAt":"2020-10-28T02:01:24.651Z","updatedAt":"2020-10-28T02:01:24.651Z","environment":{"sys":{"id":"master","type":"Link","linkType":"Environment"}},"revision":1,"locale":"en-US"},"fields":{"title":"Lightbulb","file":{"url":"//images.ctfassets.net/96ovba1yjdbm/3AMpzTspQkESn0b3QyflzJ/4b08435250f564930a74021a89df18cd/pexels-burak-k-132340.jpg","details":{"size":7141,"image":{"width":640,"height":480}},"fileName":"pexels-burak-k-132340.jpg","contentType":"image/jpeg"}}},"updatedAt":"2020-10-28T02:08:02.529Z"},{"title":"Udemy Burger Builder","path":"udemy-burger-builder","content":"The beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic started in my last term of university. At the time, I only had a single class left due to scheduling conflicts in previous terms and mismatch coops, so I was able to work on personal projects. In the beginning, I focused on machine learning projects. After seeing many job postings regarding web development, I knew I needed to work on my web development skills.\n\nUniversity did not teach web development and only gave a few opportunities to work on web development projects. The desire to expand my web development skills brought me to Udemy. I bought a [guide for ReactJS](https://www.udemy.com/course/react-the-complete-guide-incl-redux/ \"React The Complete Guide Udemy Course\"), which is taught by [Maximilian Schwarzmüller](https://www.udemy.com/user/academind/ \"Maximilian Schwarzmüller Udemy Profile\"). This course covered basic and advanced topics for ReactJS.\n\nThe main project for this course was a burger builder app. This app allows a user to create a burger by selecting the ingredients and amounts, continue to checkout, and view their burger orders. Users must create a profile to continue to checkout.\n\n![Burger Builder App](//images.ctfassets.net/96ovba1yjdbm/4DOX3zr2a9r7FQgfqBG8uM/118fe7ffe3be7f1e88d08e5213c593da/burgerbuilder.PNG)\n\nThis course has 490 video lectures approximating to about 40.5 hours of video. Some video lectures are bonus material that looks at 'Next.js,' CSS, and animations.\n\nSome components of the app are:\n- Hosted on Firebase\n- Uses the Firebase real-time database\n- Authentication with Firebase\n- React Routing\n- Redux\n- Axios\n- React Memo for a performance increase of 'dumb' components\n- Custom Hooks\n- Converted class base components to functional components\n- 'useState' and 'useEffect' are used to replace state and class-based component lifecycle hooks.\n- Unit Tests with Jest and Enzyme\n\nSee the [code](https://github.com/SDBurt/udemy-react-course/tree/master/burger-app \"Burger Builder App on Github\") on github or [Demo](https://burger-app-cdc9b.web.app/ \"Burger Builder App demo\") site.\n","imageAlt":"Burger Builder burger","icon":{"sys":{"space":{"sys":{"type":"Link","linkType":"Space","id":"96ovba1yjdbm"}},"id":"1Xbemp1jshL7tTKEIjV1Ci","type":"Asset","createdAt":"2020-10-01T18:33:29.534Z","updatedAt":"2020-10-01T20:25:27.038Z","environment":{"sys":{"id":"master","type":"Link","linkType":"Environment"}},"revision":2,"locale":"en-US"},"fields":{"title":"Burger Builder Burger","description":"Built burger with lettuce on the bottom.","file":{"url":"//images.ctfassets.net/96ovba1yjdbm/1Xbemp1jshL7tTKEIjV1Ci/afd742867fd5242e95c201a984ba47d4/burgerbuildericon.PNG","details":{"size":20185,"image":{"width":640,"height":387}},"fileName":"burgerbuildericon.PNG","contentType":"image/png"}}},"updatedAt":"2020-10-01T20:33:10.651Z"},{"title":"Portfolio Site","path":"portfolio-site","content":"I have been working on this portfolio site since I completed the Udemy course for ReactJS.

I tried Contentful and decided to stick with that. I also though about using Gatsby but that might be a different project in the future.\n- All ReactJS components are functional components.\n- Redux was not used. Since there is no authentication and extensive passing of states, I felt it would be more more than use.\n- I hook is used to trigger a rebuild when Contentful publishes a new entity.\n- I plan to work on CSS more and add animations in the future (once I have content on here)\n- I also need a link to my resume.","imageAlt":"Macbooklaptop cutoff view","icon":{"sys":{"space":{"sys":{"type":"Link","linkType":"Space","id":"96ovba1yjdbm"}},"id":"7mOizigyp9VHcrGTaKDtEj","type":"Asset","createdAt":"2020-10-01T18:42:36.176Z","updatedAt":"2020-10-01T18:42:36.176Z","environment":{"sys":{"id":"master","type":"Link","linkType":"Environment"}},"revision":1,"locale":"en-US"},"fields":{"title":"Mac Laptop Cutoff View","description":"Photo by Math from Pexels","file":{"url":"//images.ctfassets.net/96ovba1yjdbm/7mOizigyp9VHcrGTaKDtEj/b081d9fd0e6544030d543767c2d1a7c0/pexels-math-331684.jpg","details":{"size":19970,"image":{"width":640,"height":423}},"fileName":"pexels-math-331684.jpg","contentType":"image/jpeg"}}},"updatedAt":"2020-10-01T18:43:08.917Z"}]
